## Project Overview:
>> This project explores an airline dataset containing details such as flight, source city, and destination city. The analysis focuses on understanding travel patterns, route popularity, and connectivity between cities. By cleaning and organizing the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify the most frequent flight routes, the busiest source and destination cities, and overall distribution of air traffic. This project demonstrates how simple travel data can reveal insights into passenger movement, city connectivity, and airline operations.
